= deJO
Bored witless at seeing a certain author's name everywhere, all the time? deJO removes them.

== Installation

[Download the extension](./Release/Extension.crx), open your Chrome extensions page and drag-and-drop it in. You may need to enable Developer Mode.

== How does it work?

When a page loads, deJO checks the inline-elements (a, span), then the block-level (p). If it finds a combination of letters that look like they refer to a certain Scotland-based children's author with gnarly views, it removes them.

It then checks images for alt text and src URLs for similar patterns and hides them.

Finally it does a last sweep of the page using divs and any lingering references trigger it to hide that div.

== Will it break website layouts?

Yeah, a little bit sometimes, probably. Nothing major that I've seen, for example it slightly throws off the styling on DuckDuckGo's right-hand info bar if you search 'Harry Potter' but hey ho.

== Will it break links?

If the link has this certain person's name in it, then yes it will. You're welcome.

== Can I contribute?

Yeah, please do.

== Why isn't this in the Chrome store?

Firstly I'd need to pay them $5 to list it, and secondly because I have no doubt if I did then the author's team of loyal droogs would then scour the Chrome Store T&C to find some clause or other it violates (probably something about denying publicity) and have it taken down.

Who needs the hulabaloo?

== Is there a FireFox / Safari version?

=== Firefox - no but it's doable I think

Anyone who has the time is welcome to port it :)

=== Safari - no and probably not

It involves paying about $100 to become an Apple developer, then porting it in to xCode and even then Apple will probably refuse it because 'oh my! THAT author! Controversial!' 'cos, you know, they're such staunch allies...

== Why do you HATE [author's name]???

I wish them no harm and this isn't a personal attack on them. I just don't care about their ill-informed reckonings on various issues and I'm fed up of those reckonings being breathlessly reported by news outlets as if they're important. I hope they live a long and happy life, preferably one where they just enjoy their money and fame and stay out of my business.

== But what about SILENCING and FREE SPEECH?

The author can say what she wants, I don't have to listen to it and reserve the right to curate my own online experience. You do you, I'll do me.

== Well maybe I'll make a plugin to remove YOUR name!

It's a free country, go ahead. Make whatever Chrome plugins you like.

== I HATE YOU
